Baroness
========

This programm is made for simplifying the billig for beverages at an open fridge. Registered users can identify via a RFID tag and add their consumed beverages to their bill. The administrator of the system, called "Beer-Baron" can send the current bill of users via email and of course add some payments that are taken. This can be done via a web interface

Guidelines
==========

* The used language for documentation and sourcecode is English. Please! I guess that the Baroness is so usefull that other people may use is. And allways remember: "Broken English is the Engineers Language".
* Pulll and Push the code you write. If you not push, everything is getting complicated. Everything is getting merged. At least I'm hoping that.
* Commit only code which is not producing errors. (And the best would be, if the code works)
* If you think there is something that should be done, write that in the TODO.md file. Hopefully somebody will fix that or do it. If you are working on something, write your name next to the task.
* If you do something document your decissions. You are making good decissions but other people should be able to uderstand what you have thought about that.

Hardware
========

The hardware used for this system consists of an raspberry pi, an RFID reader and a small touch screen connected via SPI.
